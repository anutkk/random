# euclidiangeometry
A Python module of various 2D Cartesian plane functions.

This module is a work-in-progress including various Euclidian geometry functions that I needed and could not find in the well-known library.

The list of existing functions (to be updated):

-`simplify_pts` - Simplify a polygon specifiying a maximum number of points and a maximum allowed error.
